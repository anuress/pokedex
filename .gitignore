# Android Studio / IntelliJ IDEA project files
# *.iml files are specific to IntelliJ modules, usually one per Gradle module.
*.iml
# Other IDEA project files (less common for Gradle-based Android projects)
*.ipr
*.iws

# The .idea directory contains user-specific settings and workspace configuration.
# It's recommended to ignore the entire directory.
# Re-include only the files that should be shared with the team below.
.idea/

# Files to SHARE from the .idea directory (un-ignore them)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version Control System file, maps project to VCS like Git
!/.idea/vcs.xml
# Gradle configuration specific to the project in the IDE
!/.idea/gradle.xml
# Kotlin compiler settings for the project
# !/.idea/kotlinc.xml
# Project-level Code Styles (if you use a project-specific scheme and want to share it)
# !/.idea/codeStyles/
# Project-level Inspection Profiles (if you use a project-specific scheme and want to share it)
# !/.idea/inspectionProfiles/
# Miscellaneous project settings (can sometimes include SDK paths or other local settings.
# Review carefully if you decide to share it; often best left ignored or handled by Gradle.)
# !/.idea/misc.xml
# --------------------------------------------------------------------

# Gradle
# ------
# Gradle wrapper directory and its JAR/properties (not the .gradle build cache directory)
# Usually, you *do* want to commit the gradlew, gradlew.bat, and gradle/wrapper files.
# The .gradle directory itself (which is at the project root) contains caches and should be ignored.
.gradle/

# Build directory
# ---------------
/build/

# Local configuration file
# ------------------------
# Contains local paths (like sdk.dir) and potentially sensitive information (keystore passwords).
# This file should NOT be versioned. It's typically generated by Android Studio.
/local.properties

# Android build outputs and captures
# ----------------------------------
/captures/
*.apk
*.aab
# Optional: detailed build output for bundletool
# output.json

# Profiler & Log files
# --------------------
*.hprof
*.snapshot
*.log

# External Native Build files
# ---------------------------

.externalNativeBuild/

# OS-specific files that should generally be ignored
